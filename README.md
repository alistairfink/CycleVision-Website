CycleVision is a bike safety system meant to attach to a bike and augment cycling in a safer and better manner. This product consists of a phyiscal device that attaches to the bike and an optional companion app to allow users to take advantage of the full potential of the device.

This project was created as the fourth year design project of my engineering undergrad.
